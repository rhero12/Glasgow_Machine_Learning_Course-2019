# Unsupervised Learning

For the unsupervised lectures the only required Python packages are:

* `scikit-learn`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `scipy`

In these exercises we will go through various clustering and dimensionality recution techniques such as k-means, agglomerative clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). There will also be a look at random forests towards the end.
